# Overview

I created a To-Do list application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript. The goal was to create a functional, interactive software that handles tasks such as adding, completing, and removing tasks. I also included features like displaying random motivational quotes and showing basic statistics about the tasks, such as the total number of tasks. I added an error throwing and handling exception to go above and beyond in this assignment. I used ChatGPT to generate a list of 50 quotes to use in the program and cited ChatGPT in the program itself.

Writing this software allowed me to explore key JavaScript concepts, such as manipulating DOM elements, working with arrays, and handling asynchronous operations. It also helped me improve my skills in managing user interactions on a webpage.

The purpose of this project was to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and apply it in a real-world context. By building a practical app like this, I gained experience that I can use in future projects and on a daily basis to keep myself organized, and motivated.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used:

- Text Editor: Visual Studio Code for writing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Browser: Google Chrome for testing and debugging.


I used JavaScript as the primary programming language, handling interactions and asynchronous tasks. HTML was used for the webpage structure, and CSS was used to style the application.

# Future Work

Hereâ€™s what I could do to improve or add:

- Storage: Use local storage to keep the to-do list even after the page is refreshed.
- Task Editing: Let users edit existing tasks.
